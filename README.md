# Calculator
This repository features a Java calculator program with basic arithmetic ops &amp; advanced array ops like sum, variance, &amp; std deviation. It includes 3 Java files (Main, UserInput, Calculator) &amp; has comments for each logic block. 

# Calculator
This repository contains a basic calculator program written in Java. The calculator can perform the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Sum of an array
Variance of an array
Standard deviation of an array

# The program is composed of three Java files:
Main.java: This is the main file that executes the program.
UserInput.java: This file contains functions for taking input from the user. The user can input numbers or an array of numbers.
Calculator.java: This file contains the logic for performing the above-mentioned operations.
Methods

# The following methods are defined in the Calculator.java file:
add: This method takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
subtract: This method takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.
multiply: This method takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
divide: This method takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.
sumArray: This method takes an array of numbers as input and returns their sum.
variance: This method takes an array of numbers as input and returns its variance.
standardDeviation: This method takes an array of numbers as input and returns its standard deviation.
Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the Main.java file. The program will prompt you to choose an operation, and then input the necessary numbers or array. The result will be displayed on the screen.

# Coding Guidelines
The program follows standard Java coding guidelines and includes appropriate comments for each block of logic.
